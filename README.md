# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are hidden files. When navigating directories and finding files in the terminal, one might use `ls` to list all the files and folders in the current directory. However, this will not show the (hidden) files that start with `.`. These are called *dotfiles*, and they are often not meant to be accessed on a regular basis, which is why they are hidden. In fact, any file can be hidden by appending a `.` at its front. For example, the `.gitconfig` file is a dotfile that people using [GitHub](https://github.com/) will be familiar with.
